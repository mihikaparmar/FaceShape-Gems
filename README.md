# FaceShape Gems (Generative Artificial Intelligence)

FaceShape Gems is a project aimed at solving the challenge of choosing the right jewelry to complement different face shapes using advanced AI techniques. This project utilizes Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) to provide personalized recommendations for jewelry based on the user's facial features.

## Key Features

- **Facial Shape Recognition**: The project employs OpenCV for facial shape recognition, utilizing the Haar Cascade Classifier to accurately identify the unique contours of each individual's face.

- **AI-Driven Recommendations**: Once the face shape is determined, the system generates personalized jewelry recommendations from a custom dataset. These recommendations are selected based on their compatibility with the identified face shape.

- **Generative AI Rendering**: To provide users with a visual representation of how the recommended jewelry would look on them, Generative AI techniques are utilized. The Stable Diffusion Model is employed to recreate faces adorned with the recommended jewelry, offering users a realistic preview of the final appearance.

## Installation

- **Dependencies**: Ensure that you have OpenCV and the required Python libraries installed to run the project successfully.

- **Dataset**: Prepare a custom dataset containing a diverse range of jewelry items for the AI to recommend from.

## Usage

1. Run the provided code to initiate the facial shape recognition process using OpenCV.
2. Once the facial shape is identified, the AI will randomly select jewelry recommendations from the custom dataset.
3. Generative AI techniques will then be applied to render the recommended jewelry on a virtual representation of the user's face.
4. The final output, showcasing the recommended jewelry on the user's face, will be provided.
